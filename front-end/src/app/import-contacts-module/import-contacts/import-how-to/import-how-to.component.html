      <p>
        Importing can be done by dragging and dropping your files into the grey space provided as prompted; or also by
        selecting the file you wish to upload via file explorer. The accepted file format for imports is a CSV file
        only. You can upload up to 10 CSV files during the importing process. The system will then upload the document
        and scan it for formatting errors. If any errors are found the upload will be cancelled and a list of the
        formatting error(s) will be provided for the user to check their file against.
